# ChemistryClassUnit8EnergyFinder
Basically this thing finds the energy required to go from one state to another state, this is only working for water right now. 
If you want to use another compound all you have to do is change the specific heat in equations for the energyChange function. 
In the future I will add more features such as IcetoVapor, LiquidToVapor etc but I am tired, so that is tomorrow, so fellow chem students enjoy.
Hopefully I come bacak tomorrow and work on this, but later and have a good night folks.
